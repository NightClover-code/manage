## The challenge

I wanted to build a JAMStack website using some modern technologies for the blog content, this was the challenge:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on the device's screen size
- Providing all the content from GraphCMS (images, titles, descriptions etc.)
- Implementing a working testimonial slider on all screen sizes
- Beautiful scroll, javascript & css animations

## Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Apollo-client and GraphQL
- GraphCMS - Headless CMS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Typescript
